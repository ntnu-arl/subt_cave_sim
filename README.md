# subt_cave_sim

This repository contains simulated cave environments published by DARPA for the DARPA Subterranean Challenge - Cave Circuit ([Link](https://www.subtchallenge.com/)).
These models can be used to test the exploration planners like [Graph-based Exploration Planner](https://github.com/unr-arl/gbplanner_ros) or the [Motion Primitives-based Exploration Planner](https://github.com/unr-arl/mbplanner_ros).
